# MITRE ATT&CK Framework Integration

## Overview

PhishContext AI now integrates the MITRE ATT&CK framework to provide structured threat intelligence and explain the "why" behind phishing email classifications. This integration maps detected phishing techniques to standardized attack patterns and provides actionable defensive recommendations.

## Features

### üéØ Technique Mapping
- Automatically maps phishing indicators to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Identifies attack tactics (Initial Access, Execution, Credential Access, etc.)
- Provides context-specific technique descriptions

### üìñ Attack Narratives
- Generates human-readable attack chain explanations
- Links techniques to show progression through attack lifecycle
- Explains adversary objectives at each stage

### üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Recommendations
- **Immediate Actions**: Urgent response steps for active threats
- **Security Controls**: Technical controls to prevent similar attacks
- **User Training**: Awareness and education recommendations
- **Monitoring**: Detection and alerting improvements

### üîó Framework Integration
- Links to official MITRE ATT&CK technique pages
- Uses standardized technique IDs (e.g., T1566.002)
- Maintains compatibility with MITRE ATT&CK v13.1

## Implementation

### Backend Services

#### MitreAttackService
```python
from app.services.mitre_attack_service import MitreAttackService

mitre_service = MitreAttackService()

# Analyze techniques from email analysis
techniques = mitre_service.analyze_email_techniques(analysis_result)

# Get defensive recommendations
recommendations = mitre_service.get_technique_recommendations(techniques)

# Generate attack narrative
narrative = mitre_service.build_attack_narrative(techniques)
```

#### Enhanced Prompt Builder
The prompt builder now includes MITRE ATT&CK context in system prompts:
- Guides LLM to identify specific techniques
- Includes technique IDs in reasoning
- Maps attack patterns to framework taxonomy

#### Automatic Enhancement
Analysis results are automatically enhanced with MITRE context:
```python
# In LLM analyzer
analysis_result = self.prompt_builder.enhance_analysis_with_mitre(analysis_result)
```

### Frontend Components

#### MitreAttackDisplay Component
Interactive display with three tabs:
- **Techniques**: Detailed technique information with links
- **Attack Chain**: Narrative explanation of attack progression
- **Recommendations**: Categorized defensive actions

#### Integration in AnalysisResults
MITRE ATT&CK analysis appears as a dedicated section in analysis results.

## Benefits

### For Security Analysts
- **Standardized Language**: Common terminology across security teams
- **Contextual Understanding**: Clear explanation of attack methods
- **Actionable Intelligence**: Specific recommendations for defense

### for Incident Response
- **Rapid Classification**: Quick identification of attack patterns
