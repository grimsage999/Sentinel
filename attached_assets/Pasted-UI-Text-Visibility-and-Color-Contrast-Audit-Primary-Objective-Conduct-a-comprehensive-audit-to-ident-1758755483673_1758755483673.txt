UI Text Visibility and Color Contrast Audit
Primary Objective
Conduct a comprehensive audit to identify and fix text visibility issues without modifying core application functionality or layout structure.
Critical Focus: Text Visibility Issues
1. White Text on Light Backgrounds Audit
Search systematically for:

White text (#ffffff, #fff, white) on white/light backgrounds
Light gray text on similar colored backgrounds
Text elements with insufficient color contrast (below WCAG standards)
Invisible or barely visible text due to color matching

2. Comprehensive Text Element Review
Examine ALL text elements including:

Navigation menu items and dropdown text
Button labels and call-to-action text
Form labels and placeholder text
Table headers and data cells
Modal dialog content and buttons
Tooltip text and hover states
Status messages (success, error, warning)
Tab labels and panel content
Card titles and descriptions
Footer links and copyright text

3. Background-Specific Checks
Test text visibility against:

Dark themed sections - ensure light text is visible
Light themed sections - ensure dark text is visible
Colored backgrounds (blue, gray, etc.) - verify contrast ratios
Image backgrounds - check text overlay visibility
Gradient backgrounds - ensure text remains visible across color transitions

Technical Implementation Guidelines
Color Contrast Requirements

Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1 for normal text
Large text contrast ratio: 3:1 for text 18px+ or bold 14px+
Interactive elements: Maintain contrast in all states (normal, hover, focus, active)

Safe Color Combinations
For Dark Backgrounds:

Use white (#ffffff) or very light colors (#f0f0f0+)
Avoid light grays that blend with dark backgrounds

For Light Backgrounds:

Use dark colors (#333333 or darker)
Avoid medium grays that lack sufficient contrast

CSS-Only Fixes (No Functionality Changes)
css/* Example approaches - DO NOT copy exactly, adapt to existing styles */
.problematic-text {
    color: #ffffff; /* If on dark background */
    color: #333333; /* If on light background */
}

/* Ensure proper contrast inheritance */
.parent-container .child-text {
    color: inherit; /* Only if parent has proper contrast */
}
Systematic Audit Process
Phase 1: Visual Scan

Navigate through every page/section of the application
Test different theme modes (if applicable - dark/light themes)
Check all interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled)
Verify responsive breakpoints - text visibility at different screen sizes
Document problematic areas with screenshots and CSS selectors

Phase 2: Code Review

Search CSS files for color properties that might cause visibility issues
Identify inherited color conflicts where parent styles override child visibility
Check for dynamically applied classes that might affect text color
Review CSS variables and color scheme definitions

Phase 3: Testing and Validation

Use browser developer tools to inspect text elements
Test with contrast checking tools (browser extensions or online tools)
Verify fixes across different browsers and operating systems
Ensure functionality remains unchanged after color adjustments

Strict Constraints
DO NOT MODIFY

Application logic or JavaScript functionality
Layout positioning or element placement
Component structure or HTML hierarchy
Database connections or API integrations
User workflows or navigation paths
Feature availability or access controls

ONLY MODIFY

CSS color properties for text elements
CSS color properties for backgrounds where necessary for contrast
CSS inheritance to ensure proper color cascading
CSS specificity to override problematic color rules

Quality Assurance Checklist
Before Making Changes

 Document current state with screenshots
 Identify specific CSS selectors causing issues
 Test functionality in problematic areas
 Note any custom color schemes or themes

During Implementation

 Make minimal, targeted color changes only
 Test each change immediately for functionality impact
 Ensure changes work across all browsers
 Verify responsive design isn't broken

After Implementation

 All text is clearly visible and readable
 Color contrast meets accessibility standards
 No functionality has been altered or broken
 All interactive elements maintain proper visibility
 Application performs identically to before changes

Reporting Requirements
Issue Documentation
For each visibility problem found:

Location: Specific page/section and CSS selector
Problem: Description of visibility issue
Current colors: Background and text color values
Proposed fix: New color values with contrast ratio
Impact assessment: Any potential side effects

Success Confirmation

 Complete visual audit shows no remaining visibility issues
 All text meets minimum contrast requirements
 Application functionality verified unchanged
 Cross-browser testing completed successfully


Critical Reminder: This is purely a visual/accessibility fix. If ANY functionality appears altered during testing, immediately revert changes and reassess the approach. The goal is 100% visual improvement with 0% functional impact.
