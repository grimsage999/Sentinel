UI Design Cleanup and Consistency Enhancement
Primary Objective
Fix visual design issues including text overflow, overlapping elements, and inconsistent styling to create a clean, professional interface.
Critical Issues to Address
1. Text Overflow and Truncation

Fix long text strings that exceed container boundaries
Implement proper text wrapping or ellipsis truncation
Ensure readable font sizes across all elements
Add appropriate line-height for better readability

2. Container and Layout Issues

Eliminate overlapping elements by adjusting positioning and z-index
Ensure proper spacing between interface components
Fix container sizing to accommodate content properly
Implement responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes

3. Visual Consistency Standards

Standardize font families, sizes, and weights across all sections
Create consistent color palette for text, backgrounds, and accents
Align spacing patterns (margins, padding) throughout the interface
Ensure uniform border radius, shadows, and visual effects

Specific Design Requirements
Typography Hierarchy

Primary headings: Clear, bold, appropriately sized
Secondary text: Readable, consistent with hierarchy
Interactive elements: Clearly distinguishable from static content
Status indicators: Color-coded and intuitive

Layout Structure

Grid alignment: All elements follow consistent grid system
White space management: Adequate breathing room between sections
Content prioritization: Most important information prominently displayed
Navigation clarity: Clear visual hierarchy for user actions

Component Standards

Button styling: Consistent size, color, and hover states
Card/panel design: Uniform shadows, borders, and spacing
Icon integration: Properly aligned and sized icons
Form elements: Consistent styling and validation states

Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Immediate Fixes

Address text overflow in the "Contextual Intelligence" section
Fix tab navigation alignment and spacing
Resolve any overlapping elements causing visual clutter
Standardize button and interactive element sizes

Phase 2: Consistency Pass

Apply unified color scheme throughout all sections
Standardize typography across headers, body text, and UI elements
Align spacing patterns for consistent visual rhythm
Ensure consistent component styling (cards, panels, forms)

Phase 3: Polish and Optimization

Add subtle animations for better user experience
Optimize for accessibility (contrast ratios, focus states)
Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes
Fine-tune micro-interactions and hover states

Quality Assurance Checklist
Visual Consistency

 All text is properly contained within its designated areas
 No overlapping or intersecting design elements
 Consistent spacing patterns throughout the interface
 Unified color palette and typography system

Functional Clarity

 All interactive elements are clearly identifiable
 Navigation and tabs function smoothly
 Content hierarchy is visually obvious
 Error states and loading indicators are well-designed

Technical Standards

 Cross-browser compatibility maintained
 Responsive design works across devices
 Performance optimization doesn't compromise design
 Accessibility guidelines followed

Design Principles to Follow
Clarity Over Complexity

Prioritize readability and user comprehension
Minimize visual noise and unnecessary decorative elements
Use whitespace effectively to create visual separation
Maintain consistent information density

Professional Aesthetics

Clean, modern design language appropriate for the application type
Subtle, purposeful use of color to guide user attention
Professional typography that enhances credibility
Intuitive iconography that supports user understanding


Success Metric: The interface should appear polished, professional, and free of visual conflicts, with clear information hierarchy and consistent styling throughout all sections.
